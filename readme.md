<h3>Author: Jack Clark</h3>

<h3>Technologies: Python, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Flask, javaScript, CSS and HTML</h3>

<h3>1. Project Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this project is to create an application that allows users to enter their own dvds details.</li>
<li>Users will be able to add a DVD, update the DVD and delete it from their dashboard.</li>
<li>The dashboards will function as the primary display for their catalogue of DVDs and their respective reviews.</li>
</ul>


<h3>2. Data Models</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The app is based around 3 principles the "user", the "dvd" a user can own and a "dvd review" a user can write about a dvd.</li>
    <li>This is intrinsic to the business logic of the app.</li>
</ul>
